# Acreage Calculator

## Background

One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the total square footage in a tract of land, calculates, and 
prints the result of the conversion from square feet to acres. Create a constant named ACRE_FACTOR to express the conversion factor. Format the output to limit the 
number of digits after the decimal point to two digits.

## Directions
After accepting the Lab2 assignment, clone your Lab2 repository to your virtual machine, add your solution code and test it against the correct results that match the interface prototype example shown below. Once any errors are corrected and the program is working correctly, push it back to your repositiry which will spin up a test of your solution code. Once it has passed the auto-test you will need to submit it to Canvas under the Lab2 assignment.

## Interface Prototype Example

### Test Case 1 Output
<pre><b>Enter the square feet of the area to convert to acres: 345000
  
345000 square feet is equal to 7.92 acres.</b></pre>
### Test Case 2 Output
<pre><b>Enter the square feet of the area to convert to acres: 198000

198000 square feet is equal to 4.55 acres.</b></pre>

### Test Case 3 Output
<pre><b>Enter the square feet of the area to convert to acres: 50000

50000 square feet is equal to 1.15 acres.</b></pre>
